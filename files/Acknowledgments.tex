This document and the NREL LaTeX class file were developed by staff at the National Wind Technology Center (NWTC), including Andrew Platt, Andrew Clifton, Andrew Ning, Mike Lawson, and Paul Fleming. Alexsandra Lemke provided support relating to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) communications. A first demonstration of an NREL class file was created by Chuck Booten from NREL's Electricity, Resources, and Building Systems Integration group, which inspired this effort. The class file and this template were developed as part of work on several NREL reports, journal articles, and conference publications.
